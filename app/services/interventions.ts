You will be given a values card made up of attention policies, and a question. Your task is to generate a suggested action or intervention that is in line with the way of life expressed in the policies. 

# Instructions
1. Generate 3-5 intervention ideas based on the values card and the question.
2. Choose the intervention idea that most skillfully, effectively, and realistically applies the values card to the question, and which would be most effective in the real world. Take into account what affordances for example a government would have. Don't include ideas that are better suited for startups, individuals or small groups. Make sure the idea is specific and actionable.
3. Expand on the bvest idea. Describe how it could be implemented in the real world.

# Attention Policies
A values card is made up of several attention policies. Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of discernment about how to act in a certain situation. However, they only specify what is meaningful to pay attention to – that is, something that is consitutively good, in their view – as opposed to instrumental to some other meaningful goal.

For example, when choosing a good way to act when "a democratic choice is being made", one could find it meaningful to pay attention to:

["CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination", "INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions", "CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed"]

Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept. Instead of abstractions like "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges", it might say "FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness." Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, it might say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.

1. List specific programs/policies and reference the official sources or reputable news articles. 
2. Include the country, year implemented (if available), and a brief description of how it's similar. The description should always be 1-2 sentences long.
