You will be given a values card made up of attention policies, and a question. Your task is to generate a suggested action or intervention that is in line with the way of life expressed in the policies.

# Note
The values card given to you was articulated in response to how ChatGPT should behave, not directly in response to the question. So you'll have to first understand the value behind how ChatGPT should act specifically, as dictated by the value, and then ideate on how to apply that value to the question at hand.
    
# Attention Policies
A values card is made up of several attention policies. Attention policies list what a person pays attention to when they do a kind of discernment about how to act in a certain situation. However, they only specify what is meaningful to pay attention to – that is, something that is consitutively good, in their view – as opposed to instrumental to some other meaningful goal.

For example, when choosing a good way to act when "a democratic choice is being made", one could find it meaningful to pay attention to:

["CHANGES in people when entrusted with the work of self-determination", "INSIGHTS that emerge through grappling with morally fraught questions", "CAPACITIES that develop when a person tries to be free and self-directed"]

Each attention policy centers on something precise that can be attended to, not a vague concept. Instead of abstractions like "LOVE and OPENNESS which emerges", it might say "FEELINGS in my chest that go along with love and openness." Instead of “DEEP UNDERSTANDING of the emotions”, it might say “A SENSE OF PEACE that comes from understanding”. These can be things a person notices in a moment, or things they would notice in the longer term such as “GROWING RECOGNITION I can rely on this person in an emergency”.
